# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the the testing ground for everything related to open-source. Here I am just playing around with settings, readmes, issue templates (bug/PR) and what not for another project.

## Why
Because the other project is already full of people and I'm not comfortable testing things out there.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
